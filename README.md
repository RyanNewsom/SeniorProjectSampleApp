# Senior Project Prototype MVC Movie Application w/ additional layers to support easy portability to n-tier.
Sample application for the tutorial [Getting Started with ASP.NET MVC 5](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started) at the http://www.asp.net site. With some variations starting after init commit. Broke up the db access and bl into a service layer.

This prototype was used for an application we are currently working on. We paralleled the architecture with it to make suggestions about architecture changes. 

You can deploy the project to your Azure account.
